I'm a computational biologist & bioinformatician with a passion for uncovering patterns in biological data. During my PhD, I developed bioinformatics pipelines for NGS, transcriptomics, single-cell RNA-seq, and variant calling, working with large datasets and high-performance computing.  

I love problem-solving, collaborating on exciting research, and building custom bioinformatics solutions. Lately, I've been diving into machine learning, multi-omics integration, and precision medicine, with the goal of growing into a bioinformatics data scientist.  

I also enjoy teaching and developing training materials to help others navigate the world of bioinformatics.
